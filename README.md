Developed a chatbot-based platform designed to support individuals living with lupus. The system
 allows users to share their personal experiences, opinions, and questions related to lupus care, while
 also replying to others within the community. The AI chatbot facilitates interaction, encourages
 engagement, and helps build a safe, supportive space for users to communicate and exchange
 valuable insights.
